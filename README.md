# koolectr

The coolesta page to check and track the state of your collection as well as all the money you've poured down a drain.

Developed by an engineering student who really wishes he was on crack right now rather than working on this shit.

## Requirements

You should have at minimum docker and bun.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
